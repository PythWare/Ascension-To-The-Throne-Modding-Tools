An unpacker and repacker for Ascension To The Throne. The Repacker is designed to support smaller, larger, or original size file repacking. That means you don't have to worry about mods becoming larger or smaller than original files.

To use the scripts, place them in the same directory that contains Resource0.pak and Resource1.pak and double click as needed. .ref files are created by the unpacker, you must keep them in the same directory as the .pak files since they're used for rebuilding the pak files for repacking. The .ref files are essentially a custom metadata file I designed.

The unpacker script will also create a folder (Backup_Pak_Files) for storing backups of the original PAK files, just incase you want to revert back to unmodified versions.

Please let me know here or in the discussion section of ascension to the throne on steam if you encounter any issues.

On another note, you'll probably need unluac for the Lua files, the Lua files for Ascension to the Throne have a LuaQ signature which means they're compiled Lua files.
