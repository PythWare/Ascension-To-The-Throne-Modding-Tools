An unpacker and repacker for Ascension To The Throne. The Repacker is designed to suppose smaller, larger, or original size file repacking. That means you don't have to worry about mods becoming larger or smaller than original files.

To use the scripts, place them in the same directory that contains Resource0.pak and Resource1.pak and double click as needed.

It is essential you backup the original Resource0.pak and Resource1.pak file, like placing them in a backup folder before running the repacker script because the repacker script replaces the currnet .pak files in the directory
the scripts are at.
